Abstract 
           
            Single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, but automating its analysis remains an open challenge. Cell-type annotation represents a critical bottleneck, particularly as datasets grow in size and complexity. While foundation models have shown promise in addressing this challenge, existing approaches require extensive fine-tuning for effective cell-type annotation. Here, we present Lemur (

            . Lemur achieves fine-tuning-free cell-type annotation through comprehensive pre-training on an integrated whole-organism atlas with a unified cell-type annotation schema.

This approach enables Lemur to generate consistent cell-type predictions across multiple levels of granularity without requiring additional training on new datasets. The model demonstrates strong performance across diverse tissue types, experimental conditions, and sequencing technologies.
