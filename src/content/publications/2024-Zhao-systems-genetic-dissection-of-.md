ABSTRACT
          
            In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), changes in the brain transcriptome are hypothesized to mediate the impact of neuropathology on cognition. Gene expression profiling from postmortem brain tissue is a promising approach to identify causal pathways; however, there are challenges to definitively resolve the upstream pathologic triggers along with the downstream consequences for AD clinical manifestations. We have functionally dissected 30 AD-associated gene coexpression modules using a cross-species strategy in fruit fly (

Integrating longitudinal RNA-sequencing and behavioral phenotyping, we interrogated the unique and shared transcriptional responses to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and/or aging, along with potential links to progressive neuronal dysfunction. Our results highlight hundreds of conserved, differentially expressed genes mapping to human AD regulatory networks. To confirm causal modules and pinpoint AD network drivers, we performed systematic
