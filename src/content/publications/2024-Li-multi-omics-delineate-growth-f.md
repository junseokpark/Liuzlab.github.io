            Physical exercise represents a primary defense against age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Our study reveals that exercise mitigates amyloid-induced changes in both transcriptomic expression and chromatin accessibility through cell type-specific transcriptional regulatory networks. These networks converge on the activation of growth factor signaling pathways, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin signaling, correlating with an increased proportion of immature dentate granule cells and oligodendrocytes. Notably, the beneficial effects of exercise on neurocognitive functions can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and the downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K).

            Physical exercise represents a primary defense against age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
