Abstract 
           
            Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurological disorder caused by 
            MECP2 
            mutations. Like other X-linked disorders, RTT patients have sex-specific differences in clinical presentation due to distinct cellular environments, where females have ∼50\% of cells expressing either a mutant or wild-type copy of

Typical RTT females have a short window of normal early development until ∼6-18 months, followed by regression and progressive decline, whereas neonatal encephalopathy is more likely in RTT males. How these sex-specific differences in cellular context contribute molecularly to RTT pathogenesis, particularly in the presymptomatic stages of RTT females, remains poorly understood. Here, we profiled the hippocampal transcriptomes of female (
