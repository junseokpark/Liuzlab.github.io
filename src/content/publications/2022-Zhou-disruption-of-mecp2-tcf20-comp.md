              Loss-of-function mutations in
              MECP2
              cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome (RTT), but the precise molecular mechanism driving pathogenesis remains unclear. Using an unbiased approach to identify proteins that interact with MeCP2, we identified the transcription factor 20 (TCF20) complex and discovered that RTT-causing mutations in
              MECP2
              disrupt this interaction. Using biochemical, morphological, behavioral, and transcriptional studies, we examined the importance of this interaction for brain function and found that the TCF20 complex plays a direct role in MeCP2-dependent gene regulation and modifies
              MECP2
              -induced synaptic and behavioral deficits. Our data uncovered a previously unknown molecular aspect of MeCP2 function and revealed a converging molecular mechanism, whereby mutations of genes encoding several subunits in the same complex contribute to shared neurological symptoms.

              MeCP2 is associated with Rett syndrome (RTT),
              MECP2
              duplication syndrome, and a number of conditions with isolated features of these diseases, including autism, intellectual disability, and motor dysfunction. MeCP2 is known to broadly bind methylated DNA, but the precise molecular mechanism driving disease pathogenesis remains to be determined. Using proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID), we identified a transcription factor 20 (TCF20) complex that interacts with MeCP2 at the chromatin interface. Importantly, RTT-causing mutations in
              MECP2
              disrupt this interaction. TCF20 and MeCP2 are highly coexpressed in neurons and coregulate the expression of key neuronal genes. Reducing

              partially rescued the behavioral deficits caused by

              MECP2
              duplication syndrome pathogenesis. We identified a patient exhibiting RTT-like neurological features with a missense mutation in the PHF14 subunit of the TCF20 complex that abolishes the MeCP2–PHF14–TCF20 interaction. Our data demonstrate the critical role of the MeCP2–TCF20 complex for brain function."
