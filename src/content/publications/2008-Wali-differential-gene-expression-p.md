description: "1718 Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an asbestos-related malignancy characterized by rapid progressive local growth, late metastases, and poor prognosis despite aggressive strategies involving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The Stratifin (14-3-3 sigma) has been shown to regulate vital cellular processes that are important in cancer development, such as mitogenic signal transduction, apoptosis and cell cycle progression. In this study we have elucidated the gene expression profile of stratifin among 24 MPM tumor samples using Affymetrix U133AB chip platform. We noticed 14/24 tumors had more than 2-fold induction in their stratifin gene expression patterns compared to three normal peritoneums. Increased Stratifin expression was observed in majority of epithelial histotypes including small subset of biphasics that exhibited longer survival time (\&gt;14 months) after surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed cytoplasmic positivity of stratifin in 23/57 MPM tumor samples with minimal staining in surrounding stromal region. Unique three phospho-serine binding motif partners of stratifin (30-80 KDa) were identified among high-stratifin expressing MPM tumors by Western blot analysis. We also found \&gt; 4-fold increased stratifin gene expression pattern in five out of six MPM patient derived cell lines. A robust 2-fold induction in stratifin gene expression was found as a consequence of 5’-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-AzaC) treatment of SV 40 viral-infected primary mesothelial cultures. Studies are underway to assess whether stratifin promoter hypermethylation is involved in the down-regulation of its expression pattern seen among fifty percent of MPM tumor samples. Further studies are needed to understand the regulation and interaction of stratifin in mesothelioma carcinogenesis that could be utilized for future therapeutic approaches to combat this insidious disease."
