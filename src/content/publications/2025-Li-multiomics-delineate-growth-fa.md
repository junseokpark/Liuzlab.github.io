              INTRODUCTION 
              Physical exercise is a primary defense against age‐related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
             
             
              METHODS 
               
                We conducted single‐nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses (snRNA‐seq and snATAC‐seq) on the hippocampus of mice carrying mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP 
                NL‐G‐F 
                ) following prolonged voluntary wheel‐running exercise. 
               
             
             
              RESULTS 
               
                Exercise mitigates amyloid‐induced changes in transcriptome and chromatin accessibility through cell type–specific regulatory networks converging on growth factor signaling, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. The beneficial effects of exercise on neurocognition can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and its downstream PI3K signaling. Exercise leads to elevated levels of heparin‐binding EGF (HB‐EGF), and intranasal administration of HB‐EGF enhances memory function in sedentary APP 
                NL‐G‐F 
                mice. 
               
             
             
              DISCUSSION 
              These findings offer a panoramic delineation of cell type–specific hippocampal transcriptional networks activated by exercise and suggest EGFR signaling as a druggable contributor to exercise‐induced memory enhancement to combat AD‐related cognitive decline.
