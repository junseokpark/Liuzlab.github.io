Welcome to the Liu Lab at Baylor College of Medicine. Our lab develops bioinformatics approaches for analyzing high throughput biological data, such as gene expression arrays, RNA-seq and genomic sequencing data. Our work focuses on integrating multiple data types together so that relevant and testable biological hypothesis can be extracted for better understanding of neurological diseases.
