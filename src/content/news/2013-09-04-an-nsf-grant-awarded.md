National Science Foundation DMS-1263932 collaborative grant to study "Statistical Methods for Integrated Analysis of High-Throughput Biomedical Data", September 2013-2017, with Genevera Allen and Pradeep Ravikumar.

In the joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Sciences, each proposal received a NIH priority score from each panelist, as well as a consensus panel ranking in three categories: (i) highly competitive, (ii) competitive, and (iii) not competitive. Less than 10% of the projects were placed in the highly competitive category, approximately 30% in the competitive, and the remainder in the not competitive.  Our proposal was put in the "highly competitive" category by the NSF panel.
