Post-transcriptional regulation of SHANK3 expression by microRNAs related to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders.  Our study provides new insight into the miRNA-mediated regulation of SHANK3 expression, and its potential implication in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered SHANK3 and miRNA expression profiles.
