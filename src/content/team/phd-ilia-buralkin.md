Ilia Buralkin is a PhD student in the Liu Lab at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, specializing in deep learning for computer vision with applications in genomics and medical imaging.
<br/>
His research applies computer vision and multimodal deep learning methods across three interconnected domains. In **single-cell genomics**, he develops scDeepVariant, a deep learning framework for germline variant calling in single-cell RNA sequencing data, addressing the challenges of detecting genetic variants from sparse and noisy scRNA-seq reads. In **structural variant analysis**, he builds multimodal machine learning pipelines for copy number variant (CNV) pathogenicity prediction, integrating image-encoded genomic features with clinical and phenotypic data for variant prioritization. In **point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS)**, he develops computer vision systems for lung pathology prediction, applying video-based deep learning to clinical ultrasound interpretation using Texas Children's Hospital operational data in weakly labeled scenarios.
<br/>
Across these projects, Ilia's work is unified by a focus on adapting computer vision and multimodal architectures to diverse biomedical data. His research emphasizes rigorous evaluation, methodological robustness, and bridging computational methods with clinical and biological applications.
